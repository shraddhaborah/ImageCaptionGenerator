# ImageCaptionGenerator
# Image Caption Generator

A deep learning model that automatically generates descriptive captions for images using computer vision and natural language processing techniques.

## Overview

This project implements an image captioning system that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM) for text generation. The model analyzes visual content and produces coherent, contextually relevant captions describing what it sees in the image.

## Features

- **Automatic Caption Generation**: Generate descriptive captions for any input image
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Combines CNN and LSTM/RNN models for optimal performance
- **Pre-trained Models**: Utilizes pre-trained CNN models (VGG16/ResNet) for feature extraction
- **Flexible Input**: Supports various image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- **Customizable**: Easy to fine-tune and adapt for specific use cases

## Architecture

The model follows an encoder-decoder architecture:

1. **Encoder (CNN)**: Extracts visual features from input images using pre-trained convolutional networks
2. **Decoder (LSTM)**: Generates captions word by word using the extracted image features
3. **Attention Mechanism** (if implemented): Focuses on relevant parts of the image while generating each word

## Requirements

```
tensorflow>=2.0.0
keras>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.19.0
pandas>=1.1.0
matplotlib>=3.3.0
pillow>=8.0.0
opencv-python>=4.5.0
jupyter>=1.0.0
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shraddhaborah/ImageCaptionGenerator.git
cd ImageCaptionGenerator
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset (if training from scratch):
   - Flickr8k dataset
   - MS COCO dataset
   - Or any custom image-caption dataset

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Image_Caption_Generator.ipynb
```

2. Follow the notebook cells sequentially:
   - Data preprocessing
   - Model architecture setup
   - Training (if applicable)
   - Caption generation for test images

### Generating Captions

```python
# Load the trained model
model = load_model('path/to/your/model.h5')

# Generate caption for an image
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
caption = generate_caption(model, image_path)
print(f"Generated Caption: {caption}")
```

## Dataset

The model can be trained on various datasets:

- **Flickr8k**: 8,000 images with 5 captions each
- **Flickr30k**: 30,000 images with 5 captions each  
- **MS COCO**: Large-scale dataset with detailed captions
- **Custom Dataset**: Your own image-caption pairs

## Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics:

- **BLEU Score**: Measures n-gram overlap between generated and reference captions
- **METEOR**: Considers synonyms and word order
- **CIDEr**: Consensus-based evaluation
- **ROUGE-L**: Longest common subsequence based metric

## Examples

### Input Image
```
[Sample image of psyduck standing on a rock]
```

### Generated Caption
```
"A brown dog is running through the grass in a park"
```
